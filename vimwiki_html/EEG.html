<p>
EEG is a direct measure of electrical brain activity, with high temporal resolution and precision that can match the speed of cognition. EEG also contains a lot of potential information within the data, allowing many for kinds of analysis.

<p>
EEG is "limited to large-scale potentials", meaning we can't measure the activity of single or even a few neurons. Many brain actions take place at a spatial scale too small to be measured or analysed effectively by EEG.
</p>

<p>
Some signals can also cancel eachother out (i.e. positive right next to negative), meaning they're hidden from EEG.
</p>

<p>
It can also be difficult to localise the data to a physical anatomical location, since we only measure from the outside of the skull.
