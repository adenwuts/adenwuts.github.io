<p>
An artifact in signal processing is "any error in the perception of representation of information introduced by the involved equipment or technique(s)". It is not necessary to address all artifacts present in data.
</p>

<p>
The occurence of artifacts also underscores the importance of larger datasets, so that artifacts can be properly identified and removed without total loss of data.

<p>
Extremely common, and appear as spikes in the data. Can be removed by ICA without significant loss of information.

<p>
Before starting more rigorous artifact detection/rejection, it can be helpful (and important) to visually inspect the raw data. This can help get a feel for the occurence of artifacts and the types of artifacts that might be present.
</p>

<p>
This can be an extremely efficient way of identifying any potential artifacts regardless of source.
