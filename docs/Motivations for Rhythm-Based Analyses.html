"It is well known that the brain exhibits a lot of rhytmic neural activity" -- this applies to rhythms across spatial and time domains.

<p>
<span id="Motivations for Rhythm-Based Analyses-Phase locked"></span><strong id="Phase locked">Phase locked</strong> (or <span id="Motivations for Rhythm-Based Analyses-evoked"></span><strong id="evoked">evoked</strong>) data is synchronized across time, and contrasts with <span id="Motivations for Rhythm-Based Analyses-non-phase-locked signals"></span><strong id="non-phase-locked signals">non-phase-locked signals</strong>, which are in synchronous. Non-phase-locked signals can cause problems with <a href="Time Domain Analyses (ERPs).html">Time Domain Analyses (ERPs)</a>.

<p>
Different measurements are possible depending on whether data is time-locked or non-time locked. Note that these terms are only relevant for trial-based experiment design where there is some event that can be referred to as "time 0" (some stimulus that marks the start of a trial, etc).
</p>

<p>
(Note that time-locked data and phase-locked data are different, see <a href="https://zhanglab.wikidot.com/forum/t-1586608/time-locked-vs-phase-locked-activity">here</a>).
