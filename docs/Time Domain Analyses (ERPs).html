<p>
A commonly used time domain anaylsis method that functions by averaging out single signals from multiple trials. The average tends to discard a lot of the variability present in a single trial which decreases noise at the cost of information.

It is sometimes argued that ERP only quantify a very small portion of the information that exists within EEG data.

Averaging out signals via ERP results in high information loss, especially where there are non-phase-locked dynamics <a href="https://jallen.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/jallen.faculty.arizona.edu/files/Chapter_20_Total_phase%E2%80%91locked_and_non%E2%80%91phase_locked_power.pdf">See these notes for some more info.</a>
