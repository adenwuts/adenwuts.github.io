Compare the signal to some sine wave and compute how "similar" they are (via some similarity metric) to produce the frequency on the left, which results in the following "static spectrum".

<p>
Hence we have transformed our data from the time domain to a frequency domain. The above spectrum is 'static' since it gives a static view of the frequency over time (i.e. the spectrum doesn't change with time). We can also include time in a "dynamic" spectrum, where "power" is shown through colour.
